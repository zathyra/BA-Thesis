@article{Sabou2013,
abstract = {Mechanised labour and games with a purpose are the two most popular human computation genres, frequently em- ployed to support research activities in fields as diverse as natural language processing, semantic web or databases. Re- search projects typically rely on either one or the other of these genres, and therefore there is a general lack of under- standing of how these two genres compare and whether and how they could be used together to offset their respective weaknesses. This paper addresses these open questions. It first identifies the differences between the two genres, pri- marily in terms of cost, speed and result quality, based on existing studies in the literature. Secondly, it reports on a comparative study which involves performing the same task through both genres and comparing the results. The study's findings demonstrate that the two genres are highly complementary, which not only makes them suitable for dif- ferent types of projects, but also opens new opportunities for building cross-genre human computation solutions that exploit the strengths of both genres simultaneously},

In addition to the tagset, we develop a mapping from 25 different treebank tagsets to this universal set. As a result, when combined with the original treebank data, this universal tagset and mapping produce a dataset consisting of common parts-of-speech for 22 different languages. We highlight the use of this resource via two experiments, including one that reports competitive accuracies for unsupervised grammar induction without gold standard part-of-speech tags.},

abstract = {Although the field has led to promising early results, the use of crowdsourcing as an integral part of science projects is still regarded with skepticism by some, largely due to a lack of awareness of the opportunities and implications of utilizing these new techniques. We address this lack of awareness, firstly by highlighting the positive impacts that crowdsourcing has had on Natural Language Processing research. Secondly, we discuss the challenges of more complex methodologies, quality control, and the necessity to deal with ethical issues. We conclude with future trends and opportunities of crowdsourcing for science, including its potential for disseminating results, making science more accessible, and enriching educational programs.},

@article{Jurgens2014,
abstract = {Annotated data is prerequisite for many NLP applications. Acquiring large-scale annotated corpora is a major bottleneck, requiring sig-nificant time and resources. Recent work has proposed turning annotation into a game to increase its appeal and lower its cost; how-ever, current games are largely text-based and closely resemble traditional annotation tasks. We propose a new linguistic annota-tion paradigm that produces annotations from playing graphical video games. The effec-tiveness of this design is demonstrated using two video games: one to create a mapping from WordNet senses to images, and a sec-ond game that performs Word Sense Disam-biguation. Both games produce accurate re-sults. The first game yields annotation qual-ity equal to that of experts and a cost reduc-tion of 73{\%} over equivalent crowdsourcing; the second game provides a 16.3{\%} improve-ment in accuracy over current state-of-the-art sense disambiguation games with WordNet.},

abstract = {Crowdsourcing is an emerging collaborative approach that can be used for the acquisition of annotated corpora and a wide range of other linguistic resources. Although the use of this approach is intensifying in all its key genres (paid-for crowdsourcing, games with a purpose, volunteering-based approaches), the community still lacks a set of best-practice guidelines similar to the annotation best practices for traditional, expert-based corpus acquisition. In this paper we focus on the use of crowdsourcing methods for corpus acquisition and propose a set of best practice guidelines based in our own experiences in this area and an overview of related literature. We also introduce GATE Crowd, a plugin of the GATE platform that relies on these guidelines and offers tool support for using crowdsourcing in a more principled and efficient manner},

Frequently, such re- sources are constructed through automatic mergers of complementary resources, such as WordNet and Wikipedia. However, manually validating these resources is pro- hibitively expensive, even when using methods such as crowdsourcing. We pro- pose a cost-effective method of validat- ing and extending knowledge bases using video games with a purpose. Two video games were created to validate concept- concept and concept-image relations. In experiments comparing with crowdsourc- ing, we show that video game-based vali- dation consistently leads to higher-quality annotations, even when players are not compensated.},

This paper explores a strategy for harnessing the linguistic abilities of human beings to develop datasets that can be used to train machine learning algorithms for WSD. To create such datasets, we introduce a new interactive system: a fun game designed to produce valuable output by engaging human players in what they perceive to be a cooperative task of guessing the same word as another player. Our system makes a valuable contribution by tackling the knowledge acquisition bottleneck in the WSD problem domain. Rather than using conventional and costly techniques of paying lexicographers to generate training data for machine learning algorithms, we delegate the work to people who are looking to be entertained.},
